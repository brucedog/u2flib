## .NET Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) 

This repository provides functionality for working with the server side aspects of the U2F protocol on Windows. The repository also contains a working demo ASP.NET MVC 4 web site where one can test registering and login in with their U2F device.

The solution is nearly a line for line copy of the JAVA implementation rewritten in C# using the .NET 4.0 framework. I ported the JAVA example to .NET to help spread the adoption of U2F.
